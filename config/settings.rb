# Load settings that are used globally throughout the application.
# We load settings from a file in order to allow the most flexability
# across deployment types. Since SettingsLogic does ERB parsing, we
# are also able to load some basic settings using environment variables.
# For a full list of settings that can be applied using environment
# variables, check vulcan.default.yml.
#
# Note, once you create a vulcan.yml, environment variable parsing
# will no longer work unless you include the `ENV` declarations in
# your copy of vulcan.yml as well.
